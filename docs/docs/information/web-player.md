The default player for the Web Interface is the Web Player. For your convenience or when you are on move, you can listen to music without additional software other than your web browser. If it's not currently enabled, you can set it by clicking the drop-down menu on the top-right corner of any page, and selecting "Web Player".

Ampache used to feature a flash player, but was dropped in favor of the Web Player.
