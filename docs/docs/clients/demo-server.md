The official Ampache demo server is now up and running!

The server has been created using funding from the [Linux Australia grants program](https://linux.org.au/grants-program/).

Without the support of Linux Australia we would not be able to provide a server this easily and it is really appreciated.
We would like to acknowledge their contribution as well as their support to free software in the community.

## Access the server

Log in as follows:

* Link: [demo.ampache.dev](http://demo.ampache.dev)
* User: demo
* Pass: demodemo

## What is this server for

This server is available to be used by developers for testing the API or Subsonic backend.

It's locked down to a limited set of features but is a good way of understanding the Ampache software as well as how everything looks and works.
