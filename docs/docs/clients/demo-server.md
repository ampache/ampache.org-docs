Ampache is running multiple demo servers to allow you to evaluate features and setup options.

The server has been created using funding from the [Linux Australia grants program](https://linux.org.au/grants-program/).

Without the support of Linux Australia we would not be able to provide a server this easily and it is really appreciated.
We would like to acknowledge their contribution as well as their support to free software in the community.

## Server List

Here is a list of official demos.

The sites are using the same media library and are all accessible to anyone with restricted demo accounts.

* [demo.ampache.dev](https://demo.ampache.dev)
* [develop.ampache.dev](https://develop.ampache.dev)
* [public.ampache.dev](https://public.ampache.dev)

## Access the server
