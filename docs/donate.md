## Developers
</div>

Ampache has been around for many years now and we are still here thanks to all our [contributors](https://github.com/ampache/ampache/blob/develop/docs/ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.md).

Be part of it, that's the best donation you could do.

If Ampache is really where you want your money to go then consider helping out some of our [downstream](https://github.com/ampache/ampache?tab=readme-ov-file#credits) API devs.

    ### Plugins
    <p class="article-p">
    Some features (lyrics, catalogs, scrobbling ...) are highly independent. You can create your one without much effort and without the need to know much about Ampache code.

    ### User Support
    <p class="article-p">
    Answering questions, tests and bug isolation take us a lot of energy. That means less time for feature development. Being part of the community and helping users is an important role. Don't underestimate this work, it's an important part of Ampache's good health.
