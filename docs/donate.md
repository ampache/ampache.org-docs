Donate?!
Support us and contribute to Ampache development.
Here are several ways to show your love.

## Developers

Ampache has been around for many years now and we are still here thanks to all our [contributors](https://github.com/ampache/ampache/blob/develop/docs/ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.md). Be part of it, that's the best donation you could do.

If Ampache is really where you want your money to go then consider helping out some of our downstream API devs.

### Plugins

Some features (lyrics, catalogs, scrobbling ...) are highly independent. You can create your one without much effort and without the need to know much about Ampache code.

### Translation

Ampache is translated to several languages. You can improve current translation or even add new ones!

### General Development

Improve Ampache with new features and bug fixes. We can create a better streaming solution together, you just need to know PHP / JavaScript / HTML5.

## Other ways

### User Support

Answering questions, tests and bug isolation take us a lot of energy. That means less time for feature development. Being part of the community and helping users is an important role. Don't underestimate this work, it's an important part of Ampache's good health.

### Money

The Ampache project has been running smoothly for a few years now and doesn't need to seek donations.

Do you use one of the many Ampache API clients and subprojects? Please consider donating to them instead!
